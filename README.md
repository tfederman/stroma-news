# Stroma News

An RSS reader implemented through Bluesky custom feeds. Choose your favorite RSS/Atom feeds and the custom feed will be made up of entries of those feeds, minus any filter terms you've chosen to exclude.

## How to use:

1. Follow the "Stroma News" Bluesky custom feed. (add link here) This feed will be empty for you at first.

2. Send a DM to the Stroma News account ([@stroma-news](https://bsky.app/profile/stroma.news)) with instructions to manage your subscriptions.

   To subscribe to a feed, send a message with the body:

   `subscribe <rss or atom url>`

   To unsubscribe from a feed:

   `unsubscribe <rss or atom url>`

3. After a little bit, the Stroma News feed will add articles from this feed to your personalized Bluesky custom feed.

### Notes

Don't follow the Stroma News account, it will be too spammy because all articles from everyone's feeds are posted there. When you go to the custom feed you'll see only the posts associated with your subscribed feeds.
