# Stroma News

An RSS reader implemented through Bluesky custom feeds. Choose your favorite RSS/Atom feeds and the custom feed will be made up of entries of those feeds, minus any filter terms you've chosen to exclude.

Note: the instructions below do NOT yet work and are just an idea of how this will likely work when it's finished.

Also, this will probably get renamed to "LongTail News" to reflect the idea behind what content gets included. Because only about 10,000 articles can be posted per day, I'm excluding many common topics that can be found anywhere and want to focus on using the daily budget to include more obscure sources/topics.

## How to use:

1. Follow the ["Stroma News" Bluesky custom feed](https://bsky.app/profile/stroma.news/feed/stroma-news). This feed will be empty for you at first.

2. Send a DM to the Stroma News account ([@stroma.news](https://bsky.app/profile/stroma.news)) with instructions to manage your subscriptions.

   To subscribe to a feed, send a message with the body:

   `subscribe <rss or atom url>`

   To unsubscribe from a feed:

   `unsubscribe <rss or atom url>`

   You can also subscribe to a keyword or phrase:

   `subscribe "mission impossible"`

   `unsubscribe "mission impossible"`


3. The Stroma News feed will automatically populate with content matching your subscriptions.

### Notes

Don't follow the Stroma News account, it will be too spammy because all articles from everyone's feeds are posted there. Articles from over 10,000 different sources are currently being posted. When you go to the custom feed you'll see only the posts associated with your subscribed feeds.
